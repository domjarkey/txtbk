# Appendix B: Additional proofs

## Proof B.1

Assume a sequence of partial sums $S_n$ with a geometric decay factor. The following relation captures the closed form we will cite.

$$
S_n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} r^k = \frac{1 - r^{n+1}}{1 - r}
$$ {#eq-appendix-b-geom}

Equation @eq-appendix-b-geom yields the bound $S_n \le \frac{1}{1-r}$ when $0 < r < 1$.
