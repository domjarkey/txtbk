# Appendix A: Sample proofs

## Proof A.1

We sketch a short proof that a quadratic growth bound implies a monotone energy estimate. Consider the identity below, which we treat as the starting point for the argument.

$$
E(t) = \int_0^t (x^2 + 1)\,dx = \frac{t^3}{3} + t
$$ {#eq-appendix-a-energy}

By Equation @eq-appendix-a-energy, the energy grows monotonically for all $t \ge 0$.
