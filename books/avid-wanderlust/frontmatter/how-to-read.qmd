# ii. How to read this book {.unnumbered}

This book is organised into **parts** and **chapters**. Each chapter contains numbered sections and learning artifacts. Quarto assigns the numbering automatically, so headings and captions should not include hard-coded numbers.

## Reference conventions

When an artifact is referenced in text, rely on Quarto's native labels and numbering.

- **Sections** are numbered automatically based on the part and chapter structure.
- **Figures**, **plots**, **tables**, **equations**, and **code listings** use Quarto's native captions and labels.
- **Callouts** (including definitions and text boxes) are unnumbered; link to them using their anchor IDs.
- **Epigraphs** and **quotes** are styled artifacts that do not use numbering; they are referenced by their surrounding section context.

## How to interpret artifacts

- **Code blocks** present structured snippets that illustrate a concept or a workflow.
- **Plots** and **figures** provide visual summaries; plots emphasize data trends, while figures depict diagrams or layouts.
- **Tables** highlight structured comparisons or checklists.
- **Callouts** highlight key takeaways, warnings, contextual notes, and definitions. Definitions use a callout with a custom title.
- **Equations** summarise mathematical relationships used in proofs or derivations.
- **Epigraphs** introduce a chapter or section with a styled quotation, and **quotes** insert a styled quotation within the flow of text. Use `.epigraph` or `.quote` wrappers and place the attribution after a long dash in a paragraph with the `.attribution` class so it renders unitalicized.

Use Quarto's numbering and labels to trace references across the book quickly, and rely on the artifact labels to understand the type of content being cited.
