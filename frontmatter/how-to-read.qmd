# ii. How to read this book {.unnumbered}

This book is organized into **parts**, **books**, and **chapters**. Each chapter contains numbered sections and learning artifacts. The numbering scheme always follows the same pattern:

- **Parts** are the top-level divisions (Part 1, Part 2, and so on).
- **Books** sit within parts (Book 1, Book 2, etc.).
- **Chapters** live within books, and each chapter starts with a numbered section.
- The numbering format is `part.book.chapter.section`, with a final element number for specific artifacts (for example, `2.1.2.1.1`).

## Reference conventions

When an artifact is referenced in text, the number and label match the pattern above.

- **Sections** use `part.book.chapter.section` (for example, “Section 3.2.1.1”).
- **Figures** and **plots** use `part.book.chapter.section.figure` (for example, “Figure 1.1.1.1.1” or “Plot 4.1.2.1.1”).
- **Tables** use `part.book.chapter.section.table` (for example, “Table 1.2.1.1.1”).
- **Text boxes** use `part.book.chapter.section.textbox` (for example, “Text Box 4.1.1.1.1”).
- **Definitions** use `part.book.chapter.section.definition` (for example, “Definition 2.1.2.1.2”).
- **Code blocks** use `part.book.chapter.section.code` (for example, “Code Block 2.1.2.1.1”).
- **Equations** use `part.book.chapter.section.equation` (for example, “Equation 3.2.2.1.1”).
- **Epigraphs** and **quotes** are styled artifacts that do not use numbering; they are referenced by their surrounding section context.

## How to interpret artifacts

- **Code blocks** present structured snippets that illustrate a concept or a workflow.
- **Plots** and **figures** provide visual summaries; plots emphasize data trends, while figures depict diagrams or layouts.
- **Tables** highlight structured comparisons or checklists.
- **Text boxes** call out key takeaways, warnings, or contextual notes.
- **Definitions** formalize key terms so they can be referenced elsewhere in the text.
- **Equations** summarize mathematical relationships used in proofs or derivations.
- **Epigraphs** introduce a chapter or section with a styled quotation, and **quotes** insert a styled quotation within the flow of text. Use `.epigraph` or `.quote` wrappers and place the attribution after a long dash in a paragraph with the `.attribution` class so it renders unitalicized.

Use the numbering to trace references across parts and books quickly, and rely on the artifact labels to understand the type of content being cited.
