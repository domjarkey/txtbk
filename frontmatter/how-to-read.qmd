# How to read this book

This book is organized into **parts**, **books**, and **chapters**. Each chapter contains numbered sections and learning artifacts. The numbering scheme always follows the same pattern:

- **Parts** are the top-level divisions (Part 1, Part 2, and so on).
- **Books** sit within parts (Book 1, Book 2, etc.).
- **Chapters** live within books, and each chapter starts with a numbered section.
- The numbering format is `part.book.chapter.section`, with a final element number for specific artifacts (for example, `2.1.2.1.1`).

## Reference conventions

When an artifact is referenced in text, the number and label match the pattern above.

- **Sections** use `part.book.chapter.section` (for example, “Section 3.2.1.1”).
- **Figures** and **plots** use `part.book.chapter.section.figure` (for example, “Figure 1.1.1.1.1” or “Plot 4.1.2.1.1”).
- **Tables** use `part.book.chapter.section.table` (for example, “Table 1.2.1.1.1”).
- **Text boxes** use `part.book.chapter.section.textbox` (for example, “Text Box 4.1.1.1.1”).
- **Code blocks** use `part.book.chapter.section.code` (for example, “Code Block 2.1.2.1.1”).
- **Equations** use `part.book.chapter.section.equation` (for example, “Equation 3.2.2.1.1”).

## How to interpret artifacts

- **Code blocks** present structured snippets that illustrate a concept or a workflow.
- **Plots** and **figures** provide visual summaries; plots emphasize data trends, while figures depict diagrams or layouts.
- **Tables** highlight structured comparisons or checklists.
- **Text boxes** call out key takeaways, warnings, or contextual notes.
- **Equations** summarize mathematical relationships used in proofs or derivations.

Use the numbering to trace references across parts and books quickly, and rely on the artifact labels to understand the type of content being cited.
